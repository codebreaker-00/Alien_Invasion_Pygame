  <li> RIGHT = move_right </li>
  <li> SPACEBAR = shoot_bullet </li>

</ul>  

## How Game Ends
The Followings are the criteria by which game can end.
<ul>
  <li>You deliberately quit the game by pressing Q.</li>
  <li>Any one of Alien-ships and Our-Ship collide. </li>
  <li>Any one of Alien-ships reaches the bottom of the screen. </li>
  <li>Close the terminal through which you ran the command. </li>
</ul> 

## Change in Level and Difficulty
As we destroy all the ships of the alien fleet a new fleet arrives and this one is a stronger one as compared to earlier one as the speed in which they were travelling horizontally in the same vertical height becomes double as compared to the previous level. <br>
So does the vertical speed doubles<br>
But our Ship gets modified level by level too.. Its horizontal speed doubles after every level and also its bullet speed becomes two times of what it was earlier.
